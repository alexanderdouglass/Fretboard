# Fretboard

This repository is a set of python functions to be used for designing and visualizing fretboards for arbitrary string instruments.

Targeted functionality includes:
-Fretboard visualization for arbitrary instruments and tunings, based on note names, scale degrees, or intervals.
-Scale and arpeggio visualization both on fretboards, in tabulature, and in standard music notation.
-Generation of chord charts for all chord shapes available on a user-defined instrument.
